Respecting the purpose of our community, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
Engaging kindly and honestly with others.
Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback.
Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of our community.
